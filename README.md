# Human-Sexuality-Math-Model
A mathematical model and classification of human intimacy preferences.

Talking to a friend tonight, she asked me how long it would be appropriate to have sex with someone else.
I responded like this: "To have sex with someone is to take responsibility for it and face the consequences."
The friend replied that she never thought love was very troublesome. It's not like hooking up, but I'm worried about illness and the other person's safety."
I said, it's really not recommended, because it's bad for mental and physical health.
I think a happy sexual relationship equals (beauty ➕ sex skills) ✖️ how much you like her. For example, if a person is beautiful 9 points, skill 8 points, if I like her a lot, then 8+9*9=153, but if I don't like her, either way is 0.

Because some people even how beautiful you hate each other. This is normal.
I found this to be a simplified model so I decided to come up with a relatively accurate model.
My formula captures some of the elements of sexual attraction, but it may be oversimplified. Sexual pleasure is actually a combination of physical + psychological + emotional + cognitive results, not only depends on appearance, skill and liking, but also involves:
1. Psychological factors (security, trust, emotional state)
2. Physiological factors (health status, hormones, physical fitness)
3. Emotional connection (deep communication, spiritual fit, relationship identification)
4. Sociocultural influence (values, experience, upbringing)
In other words, sex is not only physical stimulation + visual attraction, but also the embodiment of psychological identification + relational interaction. Therefore, I have written a simplified mathematical model to consider from psychology and neuroscience, and welcome everyone to optimize it together.

今晚和朋友聊天，她问我多久才适合和别人发生关系。
我是这样回答的：“和一个人发生性关系的前提是可以为这件事负责并且承担后果”
朋友答道，她绝认为恋爱十分麻烦。不如约吧，但是担心疾病和对方不安全。”
我说，实在不推荐约，因为对于心理和生理健康都很有害。
我觉得一个人性关系快乐等于（美貌➕床技）✖️你对她的喜爱程度。举例而言，一个人很美9分，技巧8分，如果我很喜欢她，那么就是8+9*9=153，但如果我不喜欢她，怎么样都是0.
因为有的人即使再美你也厌恶对方。这很正常。
我发现这是一个简化的模型因此我决定提出一个相对精确的模型。
我的公式捕捉了性吸引的一部分因素，但可能过于简化。性关系的愉悦度 其实是 生理+心理+情感+认知 的综合结果，不仅仅取决于 外貌、技术和喜爱程度，还涉及：
	1.	心理因素（安全感、信任、情绪状态）
	2.	生理因素（健康状态、荷尔蒙、身体匹配度）
	3.	情感连接（深度交流、精神契合、关系认同）
	4.	社会文化影响（价值观、经验、成长背景）
换句话说，性不仅仅是 生理刺激+视觉吸引，更是心理认同+关系互动 的体现。因此考虑从 心理学、神经科学去考虑，写了一个简化的数学模型，欢迎大家一起优化。
